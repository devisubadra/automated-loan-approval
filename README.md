# Automated Loan Approval System

## Overview

The Automated Loan Approval System is designed to streamline the loan approval process by integrating with third-party financial services. Built using Salesforce's Apex and Visualforce technologies, this system offers a user-friendly interface for loan applicants and employs a basic decision model for processing loan approvals.

## Features

- **Automated Loan Processing**: Integrates with external financial services to retrieve credit scores and automate loan approval decisions.
- **User Interface**: A Visualforce page allowing users to submit loan applications and view approval results.
- **Decision Model**: Uses a simple credit score threshold to determine loan approval status, which can be customized or expanded with more complex logic.

## Architecture Diagram

The architecture of the Automated Loan Approval System includes the following components:

1. **Salesforce Platform**:
   - **Apex Classes**: Implements business logic and loan processing.
     - `LoanApprovalController.cls`: Manages the loan approval process.
     - `CreditScoreService.cls`: Handles API integration for credit score retrieval.
   - **Visualforce Pages**: Provides user interface for loan application.
     - `LoanApprovalPage.page`: Displays form for loan application and shows results.

2. **External Financial Service**:
   - **Credit Score API**: External service to retrieve credit scores for loan approval decisions.

3. **Development and Deployment Tools**:
   - **Salesforce CLI (sfdx)**: Tool for project management and deployment.
   - **Visual Studio Code**: IDE for Salesforce development.

4. **Version Control**:
   - **Git**: Manages code changes and version control.
   - **GitHub**: Repository hosting the project code.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create the Apex Controller**:
   - Go to `Setup` in Salesforce.
   - Navigate to `Apex Classes` and click `New`.
   - Copy and paste the code from `LoanApprovalController.cls` into the editor.
   - Save the class.

2. **Create the Visualforce Page**:
   - Go to `Setup` in Salesforce.
   - Navigate to `Visualforce Pages` and click `New`.
   - Copy and paste the code from `LoanApprovalPage.page` into the editor.
   - Save the page.

3. **Deploy the Code**:
   - Use Salesforce DX or the Salesforce deployment tools to deploy the Apex class and Visualforce page to your Salesforce environment.

4. **Testing**:
   - Open the Visualforce page from your Salesforce UI.
   - Enter sample data into the form fields and click "Submit" to test the loan approval process.

## Code Explanation

### Apex Controller (`LoanApprovalController.cls`)

- **`processLoanApproval` Method**: Handles the loan approval logic. Retrieves a simulated credit score and makes an approval decision based on a predefined threshold (e.g., credit score > 700).
- **`getCreditScore` Method**: A placeholder method for retrieving the credit score. Replace this with actual API integration or data retrieval logic as required.

### Visualforce Page (`LoanApprovalPage.page`)

- **Form Elements**: Includes input fields for `Applicant ID` and `Loan Amount`.
- **Submit Button**: Triggers the loan approval process and updates the result on the page.
- **Output Panel**: Displays the loan approval status based on the submitted data.

## API Integration

- **Endpoint**: Replace the placeholder URL (`https://api.example.com/credit_score`) with the actual API endpoint of the financial service.
- **Method**: POST
- **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "applicantId": "string",
    "loanAmount": number
  }
  ```
